I have always been interested in makeup since I was a little kid.  Every Halloween is taken very seriously with me and my family.  I love dressing up, and since art is also a passion of mine, sketching out outfits and costumes has been a great way to express myself.  When I am creating things, my mind goes into a very expressive mode and I use my creativity to the fullest of my ability.  Working in costume or makeup design for films would be a dream of mine and I would love to pursue it as a job.
