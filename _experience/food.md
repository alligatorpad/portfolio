I have always loved cooking and baking.  Every Thanksgiving and Christmas I bring a homemade family-favorite dish. On Thanksgiving, I usually bring pies... and on Christmas, I bring more pies!  I tend to be more free-spirited with cooking so if I read a recipe, I'll experiment with substituting an ingredient. My favorite dishes to cook are mainly Thai food.  I make pad thai, rama chicken, and homemade ramen. Homemade noodles are my specialty, whether it's Italian, Asian, etc.
