I attend a challenging music school that provides students with 1-on-1 lessons and group bands.  I’ve been going there for three years and I have done four major group performances.  We work in groups of about a dozen kids, ages 11 to 18.  I play guitar, bass, lead and backup vocals, and keys.  Each season allows me to gain more and more musical knowledge.  There are around four options you can choose from.  For example, this year's season choices are Jimi Hendrix, Green Day, 2010’s, and Classic R&B.  Students can choose the band that they think will challenge them the most.
